External intrruptes:

there are 3 pins on ATMega324 that seves as external interrupts.

INT0 - PD2
INT1 - PD3
INT2 - PB2

We can connect extensal input devices to genterate interrupt intrerrupt signal

To execute the interrupt service routine, we need to enable external Interrupt registers.

10 EICRA - External Interrupt service routine Register A
This register is used to control interrupt sense control bits for a particular bit

The external interrupt is used in TSOP to read codes transmitted by the wireless by the wireless IR remote.
The TSOP is connected to PIND PB2, which is INT2 pin. We have used ISC21 and ISC20 bits in the EICRA register. 

EICRA = 0x20;
