Wireless IR Remote
PB2 IS THE INPUT FOR THE ir REMOTE - tsop is connected
Page 31 from evel 4 book - infared Wireless Remote Hex codes and keys
Since TSOP has 16 bits of address and 16 bits of Data, a total of 32 bit are recived.
Besides 32 bits if address and data Uniko Dvi also recives "Start of signal(2 bit) and" " end of signal"(1 bit)
This we do by inisialising bit_position = -2, and this will only read 32 bits of address and data.
When TSOP does not recive any data, PB2 pin will be high and when the tsop rrecives data PB2 pin will be low.
